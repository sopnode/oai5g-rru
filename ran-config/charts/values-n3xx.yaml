kubernetesType: Vanilla  #Vanilla for community kubernetes distribution else Openshift for Openshift

## In case of using these charts on Openshift then please use UBI images
## To know more about them follow this tutorial https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-fed/-/tree/master/openshift

#service type is fixed to clusterIP, it is only support for non multus interface (eth0)

# These helm-charts can be used for two purpose
# 1. RFSimulated oai-gNB: Only requires 1 interface for N2 and N3. You can use Kubernetes default interface eth0
# 2. Physical gNB with Ethernet based USRP or RRU: You need to use ruInterface to connect with RU. Make sure that the ip-address you choose can reach to RU. 
#                                                 Using a dedicated interface for N2 or N3 is optional you can still use eth0. 
# 3. Another thing you can chose to use same virtual interface for N2/N3 its optional to have two different

## NOTE: To use these charts with USRP B210 you need to modify and mount usb from the host. 
## Change these ip-addresses according to your environment
# Multus interface name

multus:    # needed when gnB service will run on another interface rather than traditional eth0

## NF is the network function and tcpdump is the tcpdump container. 
## To know more about request and limit it is better to understand that how Kubernetes QoS works.
